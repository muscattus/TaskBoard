# TaskBoard

Fancy board for managing daily tasks is to come. 

At the moment, it only has authentication impleneted. I know, authentication is not the first thing you do to get an MVP, still, I decided to begin with it because it was something new for me, and it taught me a lot of new things.

Project is to be worked on. Stuff is to be added and corrected.
